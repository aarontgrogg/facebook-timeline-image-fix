facebook-timeline-image-fix
===========================

Description:
===========================
Facebook's Timeline annoyingly crops images so that
some times the most important part of the image cannot be seen,
requiring you to click the image to view it.

But then when you come back to the Timeline, any infinite-scroll items will be gone,
meaning you have to re-scroll to re-fetch them...

This makes functionality Timeline images display fully, avoiding the issue.


Suggested implementation:
===========================
Add as a Bookmarklet, click once after loading the Timeline page.
